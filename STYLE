	  fixed bug in opers.sh so rg and a get OPACCESS set correctly

	  fixed opers.sh to run oper_block on all servers for root admins

	  removed the rm -rf from auto-install so we don't get stale vnodes anymore by accident

	  added dump and rehash targets to auto-install

	  dump parses the config and makes a pretty list of opers per server

	  rehash simply rehashes all ircds the user on sshd has running using killall

	  updated usage to reflect this

	  added ossh script to support using the internal ossh function (currently does not work)

	  etc..
